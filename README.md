# Report on initial observations of the Myanmar Food Security 5W data 

This report is an overview of the initial observations and analysis performed on the Food Security Cluster 5Ws data for the first three-quarters of 2021; the issues identified and analysis have been broken into large groups corresponding with the first 4 chapters -- analysis by geography, activities and modalities, partners and beneficiaries. This report ends with a brief section on next steps and an interactive reference table and reference map. 

We have endeavoured to provide actionable information and believe that releasing this report is a necessary part of jumpstarting the process of resolving the more pressing concerns identified. Further analysis is merited in several areas; and this will be undertaken once consultations with partners have been completed. 

Unless otherwise specified, beneficiary figures in this report are the number of unique beneficiaries, as opposed to beneficiary frequencies.
